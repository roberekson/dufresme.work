## Dufresme.work

Dufresme.work is a clean, lightweight framework based on the concepts of [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), keeping only the most-needed components with a slimmer style.

**This framework is still under development and is not recommended for production use at this time.**
